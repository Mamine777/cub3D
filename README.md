# cub3D: My First RayCaster with miniLibX

## About the Project

cub3D is a personal project inspired by the legendary game *Wolfenstein 3D*, the first ever first-person shooter game. This project explores the concept of raycasting and allows the player to navigate through a maze from a first-person perspective. The goal is to build a 3D graphical representation of a maze, using raycasting principles to display walls, floor, and ceiling textures based on the player's viewpoint. 

In cub3D, the player will be able to:
- Explore a maze with walls and textures based on direction (North, South, East, West).
- Set the floor and ceiling colors to your liking.
- Move around the maze and change your viewpoint using the keyboard (W, A, S, D for movement, Arrow keys for looking around).
- Exit the game using the ESC key or by closing the window.

This project uses **miniLibX**, a simple graphics library, and involves a lot of mathematics to implement the raycasting functionality. Itâ€™s an exciting challenge that mixes programming skills, creativity, and problem-solving!

## How to Run the Project

To build and run the cub3D game, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cub3D.git
cd cub3D

cd b or cd m

make

./cubr3D ./cub3D maps/map.cub
